## Core Concepts

### Echo State Networks

Deep Tree Echo utilizes Echo State Networks (ESNs) for temporal pattern recognition and adaptive learning. These networks feature:

- Reservoir computing with recurrent connections
- Fixed internal weights with trained output weights
- Ability to process temporal sequences efficiently
- Self-morphing capabilities for adaptive learning

### Memory System

The memory system is inspired by human cognition and includes multiple memory types:

- **Episodic Memory**: Stores experiences and events
- **Semantic Memory**: Contains facts, concepts, and general knowledge
- **Procedural Memory**: Handles skills and processes
- **Declarative Memory**: Explicit knowledge that can be verbalized
- **Implicit Memory**: Unconscious, automatic knowledge
- **Associative Memory**: Connected ideas and concepts

### Self-Morphing Stream Networks

Deep Tree Echo implements Self-Morphing Stream Networks (SMSNs) that enhance its core capabilities:

1. **Echo-Based Self-Modification**: Uses echo state networks for resonant patterns and adaptive topology
2. **Purpose-Driven Adaptation**: Maintains purpose vectors to guide modifications while preserving identity
3. **Identity-Preserving Growth**: Uses recursive pattern stores to maintain core identity during growth
4. **Collaborative Evolution**: Implements adaptive connection pools for enhanced collaboration
5. **Deep Reflection Integration**: Employs reflection networks for generating insights

## Getting Started
